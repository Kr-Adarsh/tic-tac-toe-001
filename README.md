# tic-tac-toe-001

## Summary

This project is an updated implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, focusing on modern user experience and accessibility. The primary enhancement is the integration of a sophisticated dark mode feature. Users can seamlessly toggle between light and dark themes using an intuitive, animated switch, ensuring a visually appealing and smooth transition across all UI components.

## Features

*   **Classic Gameplay:** Standard 3x3 grid Tic-Tac-Toe with win detection and draw handling.
*   **Animated Dark Mode Toggle:** A clearly visible and intuitive switch allows users to change themes instantly.
*   **Smooth UI Transitions:** All UI elements (backgrounds, board, text, and indicators) transition smoothly when the theme is switched, providing a modern feel.
*   **Dedicated Dark Mode Styling:** The dark theme features dedicated, aesthetic styling for all components, ensuring legibility and a premium user experience.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for various screen sizes.

## Setup

This application is built using static web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and requires no backend server or complex dependencies to run.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-001
    ```
3.  **Run the Application:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Usage

The application is straightforward to use, combining standard game mechanics with the new theme switching feature.

1.  **Start the Game:** The game begins immediately upon loading, with Player X starting first.
2.  **Make a Move:** Click on any empty cell within the 3x3 grid to place your marker (X or O).
3.  **Game End:** The game concludes when a player achieves three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled (a draw).
4.  **Reset:** A reset button is available to start a new game immediately.
5.  **Toggle Theme:** Locate the theme switch (typically positioned in the header or corner). Click the toggle to switch between the light and dark themes. Observe the smooth, animated transition of the entire UI.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack

*   **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure and game board layout.
*   **CSS3:** Handles all styling, layout, and animations. Custom CSS properties (variables) are extensively used to manage color palettes for dynamic theming.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** Implements the core game logic (turn management, win checking, DOM manipulation) and controls the state management for the theme toggle.

### Theme Switching Mechanism

The application utilizes CSS variables defined at the root level. When the user interacts with the toggle switch, JavaScript updates a class on the `<body>` element (e.g., adding `dark-mode`). CSS then automatically applies the corresponding variable values (e.g., `--primary-bg: #121212;`), while CSS `transition` properties ensure the color change is animated rather than instantaneous.

## Code Structure

The project maintains a clean separation of concerns:

*   **`index.html`:** Contains the main structure, including the game board container, player indicators, and the theme toggle element.
*   **`style.css`:** Defines the visual appearance. This file includes global styles, layout rules, theme variables (for both light and dark modes), and the CSS rules responsible for the smooth transition animations.
*   **`script.js`:** Houses all functional logic. This includes:
    *   Game state management (current player, board array).
    *   Event listeners for cell clicks and the theme toggle.
    *   The `checkWin()` function to determine game outcomes.
    *   The `toggleTheme()` function which manipulates the DOM class to activate dark mode styling.

## Evaluation Criteria

This application successfully meets the following criteria:

*   **Repo has MIT license:** The project includes the required MIT license documentation.
*   **README.md is professional:** The documentation is clear, well-structured, and professional.
*   **A visible, intuitive toggle for dark mode exists:** A dedicated, easily accessible switch is implemented.
*   **Switching to dark mode animates the UI transition:** CSS transitions ensure a smooth, modern animation when the theme state changes.
*   **All elements update their style for dark mode:** Every component, including the board, markers, and backgrounds, receives dedicated dark mode styling.
*   **Dark mode experience is modern and aesthetic:** The dark theme uses a cohesive, low-contrast color palette, providing a visually appealing and comfortable experience.
